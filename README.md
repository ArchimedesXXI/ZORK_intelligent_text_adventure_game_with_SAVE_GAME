# ZORK_intelligent_text_adventure_game_with_SAVE_GAME
This is a "ZORK"-like ("ZORK" inspired) text adventure game, written in C#, with a simple, text-based, WPF front-end. It "quasi-intelligently" parses player's complex text input (text commands written in various ways, without any required specific syntax and possibly combined with other text commands).
